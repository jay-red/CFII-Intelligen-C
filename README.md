# Project Intelligen-C

Project Intelligen-C is a personal passion project; it is meant to serve as the 
culmination of several quarters of competition in both Colorfight I and the 
all-new Colorfight II. All past AIs were created in quick and chaotic code 
sprints, so Intelligen-C will be an attempt at slowing down the development 
process to maximize the AI performance for the summer season of Colorfight II, 
and to acheive various learning goals.

## Learning Goals

1. Understand all the information available to bots in the Colorfight II game

2. Learn to create integrate code written in C++ with code written in C

3. Deepen understanding of data structures by developing them from scratch

4. Learn to manually manage memory and prevent memory leaks

5. Develop efficient code, both in time complexity and space complexity

## Project Structure

### Container

This folder will contain all data structures and containers needed for the
rest of the project.

## Enigma

This folder will contain the Enigma framework, which will be the interface for
the Colorfight II API used for bot development.

## Network

This folder will contain the custom C++ class for interacting with the C++
based websocketpp library, as well as the C wrapper for integrating the
library into the C code.
